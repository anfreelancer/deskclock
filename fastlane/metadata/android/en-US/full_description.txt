<i>Deskclock</i> is a fork of the AOSP clock, so it offers all its functions:

* alarms
* clock
* stop-watch
* count-down "timer" (aka "tea timer")

Additionally, it adds:
* "Power-off alarm function" (alarm will ring with phone off, Snapdragon phones only, tested on LineageOS and should work on all AOSP ROMs; currently does not work on MIUI).
*Flip and shake action for alarm


<b>Permissions used:</b>

* <code>VIBRATE</code>: enable vibration when the alarm sounds
* <code>WAKE_LOCK</code>, <code>DISABLE_KEYGUARD</code>: alarm notification when the screen is turned off
* <code>POWER_OFF_ALARM</code>: make the alarm sound when the phone is off (supported devices only)
* <code>RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED</code>: register alarms on device start
* <code>USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT</code>: needed with Android 10+ to show the alarm screen when an alarm fires
